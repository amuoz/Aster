## Actor
Base class for all the entities in the game (blocks, enemies, player, power ups, ..).

When crafting a new entity you should override ONLY WHEN NECESSARY the following methods:
**Update**: Tick logic.
**Draw**: Rendering. Override only if special rendering.
**TakeDamage**: What to do when entity takes damage.
**Move**: Override only if moving entity.
**OnContact**: Collision with other entity collider.

Unreal engine actor lifecycle:

## Level
Level descriptor defined in **one.json** inside Levels folder.

**LevelInfo** variable holds all the level information.

Add new types of entities in the level: push it into **Actors** level variable. This is done in **Level::Load** method.

## Game
Main class.

**Asset** loading in **Game::InitGame** (.png, .json, shaders, .ttf, ..)

**State** variable tells game current state (Game Active, Game Over).

## Player Controller
User **input** and user **interface**.

**Posses** takes control of player actor in runtime.

## Physics engine
Physics engine simulates **collisions** and resolve them.

To add collisions to an entity call **AddDynamicActor** from entity's constructor. This will create a **PhysicActor** which is the representation of the entity in the physics engine. An entity can have multiple collisions (PhysicActor).

Disable **bCheckCollision** if you don't want the physics engine to check for collisions.

Activate **justReport** if you only want to detect non-blocking collision overlaps.

Activate **bSimulate** if you want the movement of the entity to be simulated by physics.

## Animation
Draws a piece of a texture that change over time

### .anim files
Each row represents a frame of the animation. The format of the rows is:
`Sx Sy Sw Sh Ax Ay`
* *Sx, Sy*: Coordinates of the upper-left corner of the sprite inside the spritesheet (in number of cells)
* *Sw, Sh*: Width and Height of the sprite (in number of cells)
* *Ax, Ay*: Coordinates of the actor inside of the sprite (in number of cells)

For example, for the sprite marked in blue in the player spritesheet:
![anim1](Docs/1.png) ![anim1](Docs/2.png) ![anim1](Docs/3.png) ![anim1](Docs/4.png)
The row for the frame would be:
`23 10 4 3 3 1`
